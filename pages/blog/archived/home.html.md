Lately I found myself grappling with quarter-life crisis thing (again) and I thought I should take a step back to learn about my roots and I a bit more. In this post, I'd like to tell you a story close to me, called home. A story that traces back less than a century ago...

### Pre-colonization era

If my grandfather were here today, I would ask him: Why did you migrate from China to Indonesia? What was your story? Did you ever consider returning?

While I can only speculate, I imagine he was among the many economic migrants who settled in Deli during the Dutch colonial era, establishing businesses in trade. Deli is a bustling hub in northern Sumatra known for its agricultural potential, particularly in crops like tobacco, rubber, and palm oil. Although my grandfather was a farmer in his early years, I remember him primarily as a rice bag merchant operating from the ground floor of our home on the lively Sutomo Street.

He was part of the 'Totok/Sinkek' Chinese migrants who arrived in the early 1900s, retaining their dialects (like Hokkien), Han Chinese culture, and religious practices such as Taoism. In contrast, there were also 'Peranakan/KiauSeng/Baba' Chinese migrants arriving a century earlier, and has blended with local cultures.

### Post-colonizataion era

It so happens that for the years to come, the dutch surrendered us to japan. Then, three and a half years later we belong to an independent nation with over 17,000 islands, hundreds of ethnicities, religions, and languages spread along the equator. They became Indonesian, and so I became one. During the 33 years of Suharto's rule as the second president, Chinese traditions, Chinese names, and speaking Mandarin were banned altogether. Religions like confucianism and taoism were not recognized, and was forced to convert to Buddhism. My grandparents chose to stay Indonesian and paid the price of being stripped off their roots, forced to change their name, assimilate, and discriminated.

For context, Suharto rose in power after the dark years that followed an attempted coup called '30 September Movement'. The Indonesian army, with the support of countries like the US and UK, blamed the coup on PKI, the Indonesian Communist Party, which then was the biggest communist party outside of the non-communist world. Black propaganda campaigns against the PKI escalates to 1955-1966's mass murders of more than 500,000 people suspected to be supporting the communist party. While not the main targets, many Chinese were also suspected of carrying communist ideals and lots were detained, robbed, and killed. Thousands of intellectuals who was sent on scholarship abroad by the first president Soekarno found themselves exiled and never made it home, leading to nation's loss of an entire generation of intellectuals.

As if living through that wasn't enough, 1998 came. With the 1997 asian financial crisis and the government's incompetencies, the Rupiah currency tumbles, the nation lost 13.5% GDP in one year, prices and unemployment rate skyrockets, from food shortages, attempts to increase gasoline price by 70% and price of electricity tripled. Student protests demanding Soharto's resignation were responded with police violence, kidnappings, shootings, and sets off devastating riots across the country. Many organized groups, some believed to be orchestrated by the army, targetted Chinese-Indonesians who were business owners and ethnic Chinese conglomerates dominated the economy during the time. Over 1000 died, many left the country, properties destroyed, Chinese-Indonesian owned shops looted and were set of fire, hundreds of sexual assault were reported in which most were of ethnic Chinese.

### Today

A year later, 1999, I was born. Unknowingly, I inherited the past. The general sentiment from Chinese-Indonesian parents typically goes: avoid troubles, it's better to stay quiet and hidden, follow but don't get involved in politics, limit your interactions with people outside your ethnicity. Despite those warnings, the gap today is less about race than it is about social class. When I attended high school at an international school, that made me less segregated as an ethnic Chinese, but had still kept me far removed from the realities of Indonesia like the social inequalities that had sparked violence decades ago. My experience living as an upper-middle class Indonesian is very much different than life lived by the majority.

### How much I care about Home

There's a quote by George Carlin, "Inside every cynical person is a disappointed idealist". Living everyday apathetic towards politics and social issues is a luxury for the priveleged few. For others, these affairs determines their livelihood and existence. With all naivety and privillege, I'd like to remain an idealist that believes things can and will get better if we put proper collective efforts. Because to live quietly and away from troubles is to let fear and cynicism take control. As a new generation lucky enough to be granted a choice to 'stay away from trouble', I've always felt an invisible string of obligation and responsibility pulling me towards the country. Why?

Is it patriotism? personal identity? or is it more of one's moral obligation to uphold justice?

I called this nation my home because despite being Sinkek Chinese, I'm fond of the experiences I've shared growing up and I take pride in its rich heritage and culture. Racially Chinese, ethnically Chinese Indonesian, and of Indonesian nationality.

Since moving to Canada 8 years ago, I've asked myself a lot of times: should I stay here? what's my purpose? would I marry a non-Chinese Indonesian? The last one is a tricky one. Will I be ok with my future kids not sharing the same ethnicity as me? Perhaps that identity dissonance was something my grandparents felt migrating from China to Indonesia. Except they migrated in large groups, and so perhaps it's easier for my parents with similar ethnicity, to find each other.

With those questions in mind, I decided to take an open mind that there is probably no wrong answers. My grandparents who settled in Indonesia had chosen to shape my identity, but the decision and lifestyle is mine to choose from here on out. Similarly, I should let my future kids make decisions for their own wherever I decide to settle in the future.
