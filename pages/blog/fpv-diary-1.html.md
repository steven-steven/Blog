I've been wanting write entry for my fpv learning progress, since I haven't really written about it since [last year](/blog/starting-out-fpv) when I just started it.

## Shots from EMAX Freestyle 2

## Legality
Since I started, I've became more paranoidly concerned about drone laws in Canada. I think this isn't something one could enforce easily, but still I wish to always stay out of trouble. Some of the major ones in my case are:
- away 30m from bystanders (reasonable and easy to follow)
- below 122m (noted)
- Need a pilot drone license to fly drones > 250 g.
    - I only fly microquads so i'm fine. But this is why I hold back on buying bigger quads like Nazgul5 and DJI FPV which I've been eyeing on for some time
- where I see it at all times
    - this makes no sense for FPV where we use goggles. Considering the size of the drone, it'll be impossible to even see it a few metres away with line-of-sight flying. Some reddit threads mention having a spotter (someone other than the pilot to be on site to see the surroundings). I don't have anyone with me at this time (covid). So I'll try to stay low and not fly for too long or in places where people would walk by.

## Fixing drones
This hobby has roughly been 50% flying and 50% fixing hardware problems. They say if you don't crash, you're not trying/learning hard enough.
- I've probably broke > 5 motors.
- I've cut myself while testing the motors (learned my lesson to always take propellers out when testing).
- I got my Mobula 6 stuck on my hair twice while flying.
- One afternoon, I landed on a puddle and I could clearly see smoke coming out from the flight controller board. I had them replaced (the board cost ~$70), had to re-solder everything. I painted [silicone conformal coating](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B085G42TGS/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on the new board to hopefully water-proof it and not make that same mistake.
- I've also lost the drone couple of times (crash and battery fell out), which on average would took me about an hour to find around the field.
