Day 3.

Being in that tight hotel room looking down at the busy street that evening was the most exhilarating feeling ive had in a while. As an east asian from southeast asia then moving to the west, as a minority my whole life, being surrounded by a crowd of identical looking faces felt a strange sense of belonging. In a world nothing like mine, where city scapes form a chaotic jungle of panels left and right, I strangely found myself.

The small cozy gym had a cluster of japanese friends in the corner and a big western looking man who I assumed spoke english but to my surprise, was a french guy whose studying japanese and probably as fluent in it as his english. His name was Mateo. With a mix of his broken english and my own broken Japanese, we’ve diplomatically exchanged our favourite type of bouldering routes, our shared struggle in learning japanese, a few new vocabs for me, and his go-to food, the Go Go Curry, for which I had after the climb.

Every runner knows the best way to talk to strangers is at a run club. So that night my legs carried me to yoyogi park where a local run club meets every week at 6pm. An army of 80 showed up, mostly in their 20s with an overwhelming east asian majority, but still the most internationally diverse run club I’ve been to. Someone tapped my shoulders. ‘Sumimasen’ followed with a jungle of words beyond my level. To what soon became my default way of surrendering, I responded, ‘Sumimasen eigo wo hanashimaska?’. The girl was looking for a locker to put her bag and happened to ask the most knowledgeable looking guy on his 2nd day in japan.

Prior to the run, the euphoric organizers had the first-timers introduce ourselves at the center of the crowd. Following a group stretch, we headed towards the illuminating streets of Harajuku, passing the glamorous shopping streets and the humongous tokyo dome. A Konichiwa or a ‘where are you from’ kicked off a conversation between strangers for whom lived a very different world from mune. It just so happened I met Owen, a chinese indonesian and an techie, just like me. Except he’s a citizen of Australia and now working in Tokyo. Then I met Camilo, a canadian working remotely, just like me. Except he worked for a vr gaming company through a working holiday visa and met his girlfriend on his flight here. Just as I learned their stories, I learned mine. How we can be so similar yet so differently shaped, like apples and oranges. Except we are amongst the 7 billion other kinds of fruits with unique flavors.

Omataseshimasta! Repeatedly called out as we snaked through two rows and hi fived against the adjacent row like it was the end a gruelling match. I asked Camilo what that meant and how ive heard someone said it after a meal. “You must be mistaken. They probably said Gochisoshimasta meaning thanks for the meal. Omatasaeshimasta is a phrase used to pay respect for someone’s hard work”. Ah! Similar yet so different.

Rushed back to the hotel thinking i had work that night just to realize that it was thanksgiving holiday in canada. I sure was thankful so i celebrated to sleep, as the night life played just outside the building.

Day 4.

At 8am, the road at kabukicho seemed like a battle that just ended and people were getting ready to move on with their day. Somewhere in the spectrum of hectic and peaceful. Then breaking through the silence, was the sound of wheels rolling against the ground as I dragged my luggage once again towards the station.

I’m headed towards Toda. Learning a transit system for the first time takes the same skill as breaking through an escape room. To be observant, notice every clue you can find, and make deductions. I noticed the platform number occasionally show up on Google maps, and even then not all trains in that platform takes you to the destination. I would peek into the overhead screen inside the train to identify the stops or at the very least where it’s headed and compare it against Google maps. It also helps to have 20/20 vision.

Im used to the heat in Indonesia, but the 10 am heat when i arrived toda was no joke. It caught me off guard. After all, the experience i expected was eating a yakitori, not to be one!  As my chest slowly submerges the shirt with a patch of its sweat and my skin feeling the burn, i briskly dragged my luggage down the pavement towards a family mart and got myself an umbrella and a cold lemonade to aid my travel. Before long, i set eyes on the building I’ve seen on the website months prior. A humble 5 storey sharehouse patched with ceramic tiles on its walls. Can’t be wrong, i pulled the door. The cool airconditioned breeze as i entered then seems to have completed my life.

It was a wide living room. I took off my shoes  and switched with one of the anonymous slippers in the rack as i entered the sacred place. I could see the gym, the huge kitchen, a study room. ‘Steven-san?’ The women calling out to me was a staff that id scheduled for appointment today. She spoke decent English and my Japanese isn’t, so we spoke in English. The cheerful busy looking lady then guided me through the lockers, the shoe box, shared spaces, shower rooms, my room, along w house rules. She handed papers of more rules and then a few more for me to sign. Before long, i was once again alone in this spacious empty room, with my private fridge thats surprisingly silent. The sun shoots its warmth beautifully onto the ceramic floor. The bed had perfect stiffness. I let it embrace me as i fall into a nap, knowing full well that I’ll have to work tonight until the morning sun rises again.

Day 5.

There was too much excitement for my body to get back to sleep. It was 12pm which was early given i had worked till 5 yesterday. Or this morning. Whatever it was, i shot out of bed, brushed my teeth, grabbed my tote, greeted konnichiwa to a guy across the hallway, and was ready to go when i was bombarded with notifications on my phone. I got paged. I came back to my laptop to spend the next hour verifying that the infrastructure issue was being worked on by the another team and was on its way to recover.

I arrived at jimbocho, famously known as a book neigborhood in Tokyo. Book cafes and old publishing shops spread throughout the block. Stretching from the corner exterior to the alleyways were some bookshelves where anyone passing could enjoy. I saw two japanese boys in their early 20s sharing a book and a laugh. Here there were also japanese books but the comfort of the scene transcends culture and it was definitely worth a visit.

Another one tucked in the neighborhood was a 2 floor library where i found tons of international books. I saw few dozen on indonesian history, titles ive never heard, and a rich collection you’d rarely find elsewhere. Its a place one could literally sit for long periods of time while traveling through places, time, ideas through the mind of others.

Naturally jimbocho inspired me to learn to read japanese. Someday, Id come back and read through words i couldnt that day.

Walking from jimbocho to ginza was further than i thought as I didnt do quite a good job mapping the map to the scale of reality. Soon I passed imperial palace along with many runners that circled around it and I was excited. As the sun was setting, i found myself in front of the destination - the asics flagship store.

Like many of my recommendations, Tiktok was where I learned that this crowded store was a place that lets you rent shoes, gears and lockers for $20. After some translation issues, the staff finally caught on and got me in the waiting list for the lockers. I selected a pair of AsIcS superblast and a set of clothes while waiting for people to come back from their run, slightly anxious that i would be late for work that night. As soon as the staff called me, i rushed to the locker room, changed and stepped out for multiple rounds around the imperial palace. Running enthusiasts of various ages paced around the perimeter while the bright city lights shined upon us that night. Humidity wringers every bit of sweat from the body and 10km later i head to take a well-deserved cold shower at the store.

Day 6.

I was frolicking around my new neighborhood when i saw a class of teenagers in uniform going home. Something about that scene makes life seem so peaceful. Did i long for childhood again, or was it the quiet town that seemed to have stripped away the pressure of society? I wonder what mundane conversation the kids would have at the dinner table today? After all, we did experience today for the first time.

A group of international friends were cooking in the kitchen and i took the chance to get to know them. Thomas came from the UK with a working holiday visa and aspired to work as a bartender. His partner who is japanese stood silently beside him is Sherry. Niel came from Italy as a language student and was busy being the head of the kitchen.

Day 7.

I woke up on the wet misty afternoon carrying a drowsy mind still full of work from the other day. I looked around the various things littered around the floor and table that were empty just days earlier, deciding it was time to reset.

There seems to be a large barrier to throwing trash. For a country so convenient, I suspect this system must be an intentional friction. To wash trash before putting them in the right bin is an act of care for where wastes end up after they’ve been consumed. I pondered as I stood in front of the confusing poster pinned to the board on the living room wall. PET bottles became my favorite type of garbage. Burnables perhaps meant compostables? Non-burnables are washed non-compostables? What if i don’t wash them?

While enjoying the warmth of japan’s advanced toilet seat technology, i consulted tiktok for place recommendations (jap: osusume) and decided to head for Itabashi.

By this time the sun had shine through the quiet street of Itabashi and I saw the cafe stood. A lovely old couple glanced at me as I entered. An old man in his 60s stood at the kitchen surrounded by a bar where his wife was standing. Both glancing at me, I shyly raise an index finger, ‘Ichi nen kudasai’.

I sat on the wooden seat by the corner table. A teenage couple was on a date at the table beside me, two middle aged women chattered and laughed by the window, a man in his early 30s who sat at the center table was finishing up his last bite of pancake. Soon, the old woman handed me a menu. I was able to decipher the katakana. Me-ron-So-da-fu-ru-to. Panjeki. I called her again and ordered just that.

Behind the womens’ chatter and the couple’s quiet conversation was a calm piano playlist by Hiromi. The piano cover so subtly familiar, I had to search it up on shazam. Blackbird. Yes, it played through the air filling in the gaps of conversation and thought. Then the antique telephone that was on the small table rang.

The old woman approached me with a plate of thick three stacked round pancake. It came hot served with a jar of maple syrup. Then a strange green soda drink with ice cream float on top stood next to the plate of pancake. The drink turned out delightful and I began to wonder why soda and ice cream had not been as popular as ramen and anime. The pancake was like nothing I’ve tasted before. Elegant and magical. As if frozen in an era where nothing else matters in life but a beautiful afternoon meal.

That was cafe Pinocchio. Ran by a lovely couple, they’ve served fresh pancakes and good vibes for more than half a century; long before my existence. But in a slice of time, I, who could’ve been anywhere else, was there. Savouring it all.

I was done eating and the woman guided me to the cash register. From behind the counter, the old man spoke to me. ‘Where are you from?’ ‘Indonesia’ I said. Delightfully surprised he pointed at the Balinese painting by the wall behind where I’ve sat and told me they’ve visited. ‘Ryoko?’ I asked and they hai-ed me w a smile. I pulled my card out and awkwardly tried to speak in the language more familiar to them ‘Kado de daijobu deska?’ I asked. As i tapped my card she asked what I was doing in japan. ‘Ryoko. Nihon wa benkyoshiteimas’. I was language maxxing. ‘Muzukashi ne. Ganbatte!’ I smiled, bowed, muttered gochisousama, and left feeling like I could think of them for a very long time. If there was a reason for me to continue learning japanese, that was enough. An old lady who I barely knew put her trust in me and told me to fight on. I can’t remember the last time I interacted with someone their age. I miss my grandparents a whole lot.
