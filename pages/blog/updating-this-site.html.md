I've recently migrated all of the code, soo treat this post as a housewarming party! ðŸ¥³ It has long been in my todo list. I had to touch 2 files for every post I made, npm library updates was creeping in, and 5-year old technology felt so outdated! (or I haven't had the dedication to update it) I just thought it would make more sense (efficiency-wise, cost-wise, and fun-wise) to ditch it and spin up a new simpler home.

For nostalgia, here was very first blog post about building the old site: [blog/creating-this-site](/blog/creating-this-site)

Here is some exciting new tech:

- Sitepress
- Markdown-rails
- Sprocket Asset Pipeline
- Fly.io + Docker
- Stimulus
- Tailwind
