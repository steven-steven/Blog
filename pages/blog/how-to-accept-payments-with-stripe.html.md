While reading Noah Kagan's [Million Dollar Weekend](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/145624504) and Josh Kaufman's [The Personal MBA](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9512985-the-personal-mba), they both mention the same idea: Validate your idea by getting paid. You can call it 'shadow testing', a means of selling an offer before it actually exists.

With that in mind, I went to setup a simple payment page for a side-project I was working on, Social St. After investigating and scrolling through indie-hackers, the few options knocking at my door was:

1. Stripe
2. Paddle
3. Chargebee

I heard Paddle simplifies taxing complexities for you, and it works globaly with many payment providers under the hood. Chargebee also looks pretty polished and was free for the first 250 K USD, unlike Paddle and Stripe which charges fees per transaction. In the end I chose Stripe because of smaller fees, is most common to me, and to my surprise was easy to integrate. They're docs was ðŸ˜˜, and they have this very accessible 'test mode' switch that allows you to confortably test with a couple of test credit cards that will either suceed/decline/authenticate.

For receiving online payments, they have 3 integrations as highlighted in [this page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments).

- A no code solution of just inserting a link
- Stripe checkout which uses your backend to redirect the response to a stripe page
- Stripe elements if you'd like to build the form UI yourself.

I chose Stripe Checkout offering simply as it was recommended.

### Step 1:

Follow the instruction in [the quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart). Copy the code into your backend (ie. in my case, Rails controller), such that requesting the resource would setup the Stripe checkout session and response a redirect to Stripe. You will also provide routes to the pages for when the checkout suceeded/cancelled.

### Step 2:

When setting up Stripe checkout session, they recommended you to pass Price ID which comes from Stripe's preconfigured product and price information. You'd have to create a product upfront or easily via your [Stripe Dashboard's product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products). There you can define your product and its description, image, price, metadata etc. After defining product in test mode, you can instantly move it to your production dashboard on a click of a button.

### Step 3:

Setup the branding for your page. This means defining the looks and feel of your checkout page to suit your brand. Get here through Settings > Business > Branding.

### Finally

That's it! Obviously there's much more to Stripe than what I've explored, but I was able to get something up within a few hours and that felt good. Thought it would be more complicated than that.
