Not all those who wander are lost. Visiting Mauritius was one of those moments where I knowingly chose to step into the unknown, allowing discoveries to unfold before me.

It's a small island in the Indian Ocean, located east of Madagascar. Once uninhabited, Mauritius was home to the now-extinct flightless Dodo birds and has a rich history marked by the occupancy of the Dutch, French, and British. The famous Charles Darwin also visited the island during his travels in the 1800s. Over the past four centuries, Mauritius has witnessed the legacy of slavery and impacts of labor immigration from around the world, ultimately evolving into a vibrant multicultural society.

It's fascinating to think that this hidden gem, with its vibrant tapestry, welcomed me with open arms - and perhaps a cocktail or two! I felt like a twenty-first century explorer uncovering a treasure trove of experiences that were both foreign and intriguingly familiar at the same time. Lucky for you, I'm here to share and spoil all the surprises from my visit, giving you a reason to feel a twinge of jealousy - and perhaps, inspiring you to consider paying this incredible country a visit!

Delightfully seated on the nine-hour flight time from Jakarta with a stop-over at Malaysia, I became acquainted with a Filipino guy who was working under contract for Air Mauritius, the airline that was taking us to our destination. When we arrived, I bid him farewell and, for the first time, set foot on the African continent.

The warm island breeze that greeted me was a delightful surprise. It was winter, yet the air felt slightly warmer than your typical Canadian fall. I later learned that weather varied widely depending on your location on this small island - some areas bask in summer heat, others experience rainy days, while some are surprisingly chilly at night.

Alongside the fluctuating weather, the landscapes were stunning. I couldn't help but fall in love with the sight of the mountain ranges. I'll begin my story of how I conquered two big mountains.

## The mountains

**Mount Le Morne**

One clear morning, a backpack was lightly packed with essentials, including a three-liter bottle of water and a drone. We were ready to go to what was by far my hardest, steepest and scariest hike, a UNESCO World Heritage Site rising 556m above sea level. Mount Le Morne symbolize the struggle for liberty as runaway slaves in the late 18th - early 19th century seeks shelter in the deep woods of this mountain for years.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne4.png "=500x500")

Our car parked along with many others on the rocky terrain, and we began our hike at the foot of the mountain. Our walk began with views of ancient trees, heavy vines, and gigantic rocks along a paved incline that stretched through the mountains. But as the incline steadily increased, the pavement gave way to rocky ground.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne10.png "=300x300")

Spectacular viewpoints unravels themselves at the halfway point, where we stopped for water break, catch a breath, and celebrated how far we've climbed. From up there, the vast ocean was framed by a patchwork of shades created by the varying depth of the pristine waters surrounding the island, while tiny specks of people engage in water activities like parasailing near the coast.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne5.png "=500x500")

I asked how far we were from the peak, and William pointed upward at an eighty-degree angle toward a cross at the summit, barely visible to my 20/20 vision. You're joking!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne6.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne7.png "=500x500")

After that halfway point, things got real, and we quickly realized that a guide would be essential. Luckily, William was with us and knew the trail well from his previous hikes. Although we had planned to switch roles as porters, my shoulders gave out during the first half, and he kindly took the bag for the remainder of the journey üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Before long, the terrain forced us to use all four limbs to navigate the rocky path. Intrusive thoughts crept in, reminded me that one misstep or putting my weight on an unstable rock could send me tumbling down the slope, dragging me against the ground, and possibly rolling off a cliff. Would be fun ammirite üôÉ What's the survival rate? I almost asked, but then restrained myself on a second thought. Let's not dwell on that as I resolutely refused to look back - aka, down. I consider myself a seasoned climber, but my heartbeat says otherwise. At one point, I was definitely out of breath and had to stop to catch them back. Hiking isn't for the faint hearted.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne1.png "=300x300")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne8.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne9.png "=500x500")

A little bit further after having passed the most difficult part, we finally reached the peak. At last I could take a moment to enjoy the scenery without worrying about my life at risk (for now). It was glorious to see how high we were, and felt disbelief that I had made the journey by foot - and hands. We saw a few people resting at the peak, gazing out at the horizon beyond the cliff. I felt overwhelmed and vulnerable by the stark contrast between the unforgivingly rugged, high terrain and the serene panoramic view of the island, which appeared beautifully untouched. I could seep in this scenery for days, but in the effort to capture the moment before more people enters the plateau, we took pictures and I flew my drone.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne2.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/lemorne0.png "=200x200")

Unpopular opinion: I actually found the descent to be less scary. This time, I could have my back against the ground and take in the stunning views around me. I bid farewell to the mountain, feeling confident that the second time wouldn't be as daunting. Overall, the ascent took us 1 hour 40 minutes up and 2 hours to get back down. By the end of it, I was more than ready for well-deserved late lunch at KFC.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/kfc.png "=500x500")

**Mount Signal**

"It's a race!" aunt Min declared, and I felt the challenge ignite within me. Nestled at the heart of the capital, Port Louis, Signal Mountain boasts an uphill trail leading to its summit. While not as extreme as Le Morne, it offers a solid cardio workout for all ages.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/signal0.png "=300x300")

Some sections were incredibly steep. My running cadence increased as my strides became noticeably shorter compared to my usual walking pace. But I pressed on. Along the way, I spotted people sprinting, impressively fit individuals in their 50s and 60s jogging with ease, and families enjoying leisurely strolls together. After 24 minutes, I completed the 2.8 km with an elevation gain of 244 meters, clocking in an average pace of 8:41 min/km. I humbly won the race, obviously.

The prize for my victory? A breathtaking view of Port Louis from 323 meters above sea level, just before sunset. It was nothing short of mesmerizing. In the distance, I could see the container cranes at the port, the horse racing track, factories, and tightly packed neighborhoods. Cars streamed back home after a long day, while a mountain belt around the capital enhanced the enchanting landscape. Having such a towering landmark in the midst of a bustling city must be a privilege for those who have lived here for centuries. This trail has woven itself into their daily lives, promoting health and longevity, and I felt grateful to have experienced it, even if just for a fleeting moment.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/signal1.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/signal2.png "=500x500")

It got dark quickly. I shared an Indonesian nursery rhyme, "Naik ke Puncak Gunung," with Aurelie, as it had been playing on repeat in my head for a while. The familiar melody lightened our spirits as we made our way back down.

On our return, Danny treated us to drinks during a stop at the grocery store. I grabbed myself a bottle of Fiesta, a refreshing sparkling pear drink made locally in Mauritius. The fizzy sweetness was just what I needed to quench my thirst, and it felt like the perfect way to celebrate the little victory on the mountain.

## The sea

**Scuba diving**

If climbing up Le Morne didn't scare you enough, maybe you should try scuba-diving! We arrived to La Pirogue hotel in the morning where the diving company we booked operates. A brown man in his 30s approached and introduced himself as our instructor. His thin beard and hair was thick and wavy in a way that resembles Jack Sparrow in my head. We changed into our dive suits, masks, fins, and headed to a swimming pool where they strapped the oxygen tank and regulator. These accessories were now my lifeline, an extension of my respiratory system that I depend on to keep me alive.

In the swimming pool, Jack Sparrow led our training. He demonstrated how to clear water from our goggles, retrieve our mouth regulator if it should slip away, emphasizing the importance of staying calm and collected under pressure. We watched each other practice the drill: purposely filling our goggles with water and blowing them out, letting go of the mouth regulator and retrieving them back. Not as easy as it sounds. A water-filled goggles or loosing a regulator underwater means losing your senses/organ, and it requires a high trust in your decision-making process. Luckily it's just a pool, so we had second chances when we messed up; but soon these skills should be second nature. Using hand gestures, he taught us the essential signals for underwater communication, like when there are issues, whether you're ok, and answering how much oxygen left in your tank. We practiced to control the bouyancy control device or managing our bouyancy through the control of our breath.

I appreciated the hour-long training, especially considering that during my first time diving in Thailand, we were taken underwater with almost no practice. This time, I felt confident. No big deal. We will survive.

We waited another hour until schedule. More people came and we took our accessories down to the boat, where the engine carried us against the waves to the deeper sea. When the engine shuts, each of us were to take turns to flip off the boat, marking the beginning of our underwater operation. As I sat on the edge of the boat, the gentle rocking of waves beneath me filled me with anticipation. Clutching my mask tight, I took one deep breath, feeling the cold ocean breeze, I leaned back, pushed myself off the boat's edge. Momentarily, my heart flipped along with the world, and the sound of splash as I broke the surface and submerged into the blue. I saw my friends going down the anchor chain and I followed suit. As I descended, the pain in my ears calls out for a gently pinch of my nose to equalize the pressure. With a slight pop, the pressure in my ears balanced out. In no time, we were all 10m below sea level, amongst the millions of creatures in its habitat.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/diving3.png "=500x500")

We encountered a lion fish with its venomous light blue fins, ancient shipwrecks and cannons that has now become ecosystems reclaimed by nature, and an octopus squirting its ink as the guide disturbed him in his cave. That was surely a questionable behavior. Was it ethical to break the octopus's peace? How the hell did he know there was an octopus underneath the cave? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/diving0.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/diving2.png "=500x500")

In contrast to our diving adventure in Thailand, I noticed that the corals here were less vibrant and there weren‚Äôt as many fish. However, this experience was far more enjoyable overall because everything went off without a hitch. Unlike last time, I didn‚Äôt find myself panicking, having difficulty staying submerged, or gulping down seawater!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/diving1.png "=500x500")

When our oxygen tanks were almost drained, we held hands and formed a circle. Soon enough, we emerged back into the world that I knew - the world that Princess Ariel had dreamed of when she was a mermaid. I felt alive as I took off my regulator and breathed in the air that my lungs were designed for. Stranded in the middle of the ocean, I looked around and found my friends. I called out to Aurelie, pointing out the nose bleed she had.

Amongst the waves, a sound of engine approached. A boat was coming to our rescue! We removed our gear and took turns ascending the ladder to board the vessel. I glanced at the Garmin watch I had bought months ago, feeling grateful that it made it through the adventure unscathed as well. With it still ticking away, we set off back to shore, feeling very much alive!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/diving4.png "=300x300")


**Catamaran**

The sea might just be the best place to escape. Here I was again, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by my good friends, complimentary drinks, and loud music. We were aboard a catamaran, soaking up the sun, visiting nearby islands, spotting monkeys, and checking out a waterfall. That day, I also managed to get a few shades darker despite spreading on multiple layers of sunscreen throughout the day.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/catamaran2.png "")

I did get to fly my drone above the catamaran, capturing stunning views with the mountains as a backdrop.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/catamaran0.png "")

Grilling chicken in the middle of the sea definitely set the vibe, but I was a bit let down at lunchtime when I discovered that the chicken was mostly burnt.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/catamaran1.png "")

We were dropped off on a smaller island for a few hours under the glaring sun. Concerned about the heat, we eventually spread on another layer of sunscreen and decided to take a dip in the lagoon to cool off. We spent our time chatting and spilling the tea about our lives while floating around in refreshing water. We played spikeball for a bit, but that didn‚Äôt last long once we started stepping on the millions of pinecones scattered across the sand. Ouch!

At one point, I excused myself for a quick bathroom break and stumbled upon a majestic Banyan tree - locally known as La Fourche tree. Its thick, heavy vines formed a sprawling network around the trunk, making it perhaps the most beautiful tree I‚Äôve ever seen. I stood there, utterly mesmerized by this giant, wondering how old it might be and what myths or symbols it could represent for many throughout its lifetime. The roots and vines twisted and turned in all directions, intertwined and strong. My intrusive thoughts kicked in, and swung on one of the vines like Tarzan.

Ultimately, the tree left a lasting impression on me, becoming the highlight of this escape ‚Äî its majestic presence etched in my memory, much like the sun that left a watch tanline on my wrist, serving as a reminder of the adventures that unfolded.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/tree1.png "=400x400")

**Snorkling**

As part of the Luxe Grand Baie hotel‚Äôs inclusive activities, we had the incredible opportunity to go snorkeling ‚Äî a truly worthwhile experience! They took us out to the middle of the ocean on a glass-bottom boat and provided all the gear we needed.

While there weren‚Äôt as many fish as I‚Äôd hoped, we did encounter some massive giant, colorful brain corals.

William showcased his impressive horizontal bubble ring technique, which I couldn‚Äôt quite master. At one point, we all took off our masks and dove as deep as we could to snap some great pictures with the corals. The big waves made it a challenge to stay afloat, and when the water splashed into our mouths, the saltiness felt like a reckless indulgence. After a while, we decided to head back to the boat, feeling tired and salty.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/snorkel0.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/snorkel1.png "=500x500")

**Underwater sea walking**

My initial impression of the underwater sea walking activity was not great. The oversized helmet looked like it was plucked straight from a Spongebob episode‚Äîlike something a talking scientist squirrel would put on.

After the short briefing on the floating dock, I strapped a weight belt around my belly, descended the ladder, and placed the helmet on my head while still above water. Ignoring the hose dangling inside the helmet, I plunged beneath the surface and settled onto the seabed.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/underwater2.png "=500x500")

It was a novel sensation to be fully submerged while my head remained dry and still breathing per usual. No water was seeping into the helmet, there were no oxygen tanks to carry, just me being human underwater. What is this sorcery?

A perfect science fair case study. Perhaps the umbilical cord-like hose feeding into the helmet supplies fresh oxygen. There must be some pressure regulation at play such that an equal pressure in and out of the helmet prevents water from entering. As for where the exhaled CO2 goes, maybe the pressurized air entering somehow expels it out of the helmet (?) Science!

A guide led the walking tour, and we followed his path in a single file line. Walking underwater proved to be quite a challenge, and I did my best not to slow down the group behind me. The vibrant habitat around us was stunning, particularly as we found ourselves surrounded by a school of Scissortail Sergeant fish. Living among the coral reefs, I'm sure they played a vital role in the ecosystem. I quickly grew fond of them and jokingly vowed to never eat fish again (jk, but could I really?).

As we neared the end of the tour, the guide passed around a piece of baguette. It wasn't for us, but the fish. Who would‚Äôve thought fish had an appetite for bread too? It became our peaceful offering, and soon the whole school crowded around us, eager for a taste. It was also the perfect opportunity to snap some pictures to commemorate our newfound fame. Despite the little pinches as they tried to snatch a share, it was nearly impossible to hold onto them. Those slippery little guys were just too fast!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/underwater3.png "=300x300")

By the time I climbed back up the ladder to shore, the cold breeze caught me off guard. It was a fun little tour, and I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing it again!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/underwater0.png "=500x500")

**Parasailing**

On the count of three, the wind caught us, and we soared 100 meters into the air. I was wearing a bright yellow life jacket, strapped securely into a snug harness. There were two of us: one sitting in front, holding the camera, while I sat at the back, responsible for pulling the rope left and right during landing. A host was on the speedboat, expertly pulling us along, tethered to our harness.

Above us, a massive, colorful parachute billowed against the sky. As I gazed down at the stunning palette of clear waters beneath us, the shoreline of the island, and the majestic mountains on the horizon, I felt like a human drone. In that moment, I was struck by how small I felt against the vastness of the world below, and yet right at that moment, I felt an exhilarating sense of freedom.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/parasailing0.png "=500x500")

**Paddle board**

At the hotel, I decided to try paddle boarding for the first time, picking up a board from the rentals booth. Initially, I struggled to keep my balance, wobbling like a newborn giraffe on ice. But after a little while, I found my rhythm. I transitioned from kneeling to standing, moving around in circles, and feeling the gentle waves beneath me as they playfully challenged my balance.

It turned into a wonderfully relaxing and bonding experience with both myself and nature. I stayed out long enough to truly enjoy the tranquility of the water, and by the time I paddled back to shore, I felt a surge of accomplishment‚Äîlike I had finally mastered the art of paddle boarding no problem!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/board0.png "=500x500")

**Water skiing**

Among us, I was volunteered to go first. With a mix of nervousness and excitement, I slipped on the water skis, strapping the long, heavy boards to my feet.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/ski0.png "=500x500")

I took a deep breath and dove into the ocean, gripping a long metal pole protruding from the side of the boat with both hands. The tip was to keep my feet at a 90-degree angle and my arms straight out in front of me. It felt a bit awkward, but I trusted the process and held the position as best as I could. As soon as the engine roared to life, I was pulled forward, slowly rising up onto my knees from the drag. With my hands straightened, I stood a little taller, and it felt absolutely exhilarating. We sped across the water, and I felt weightless, like Superman defying gravity. I tried to keep my eyes open despite the rush of adrenaline coursing through me.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/ski1.png "=500x500")

Before long, we came to a stop, and the driver passed me a handle attached to a two-meter rope for the second stage of the mission. It was the same concept as before, but instead of holding onto the pole, I now had to grip the handle attached to the rope. When the engine roared back to life, I slowly rose to my knees again, but this time I stumbled and let go of the rope in a moment of panic.

I took another two attempts, but each time failing miserably. Balancing on the skis was much trickier than it looked, and as the boat accelerated, I found it increasingly difficult to maintain my grip on the handle. It felt like a game of tug-of-war with the ocean, and I was losing.

Despite the challenges and my less-than-stellar performance, I returned to shore feeling accomplished ‚Äî I had faced my fear and given it my all. I knew I would definitely give it another try one day, hoping that I‚Äôd muster a bit more courage and a better grip next time!

## Luxe Grand Baie

We stayed at Luxe Grand Baie for a few nights ‚Äî a stunning 5-star hotel that had just opened two years ago on the northern shores of Mauritius. From its striking indoor-outdoor architecture to the elegant interior design, the hotel was a feast for the senses. The fancy buffet, rooftop infinity pool, hydrothermal spa, and well-equipped gym were just the beginning. With a beautiful beach, a variety of water activities, pilates lessons, and even a private heated pool on our room's patio, Luxe Grand Baie was packed with indulgent experiences.

And indulge we did! I had the chance to try new activities like water skiing and paddle boarding, and I even enjoyed the unique luxury of the living room space, chromotherapy shower, and a joystick-controlled faucet that I secretly wished I could take home with me. Our stay transformed into something truly unforgettable. Every moment felt like a slice of paradise, and I couldn't have asked for a better getaway.

P.S > expensive hotel

## Trail run

The spectacular terrain, breathtaking views, and perfect climate make Mauritius a very attractive destination for running. Unfortunately, we were unlucky enough to miss the annual Dodo Trail event in June. Nevertheless, we found the Hilton Charity Trail Run online and signed up months in advance. It was the same price for both the half-marathon and the 10K, but since I had never experienced the Mauritian climate before, I decided to register for the 10K out of fear that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to adjust to the new environment. Looking back, I‚Äôm sure am glad I did!

We arrived 10 minutes late that morning. ‚ÄúQuick! Go!‚Äù shouted one of the organizers. He instructed us to turn left after 500 meters, and sure enough, we missed the turn and ended up at a dead-end üòµ. After retracing our steps and asking another organizer for directions, we discovered that the ‚Äúleft turn‚Äù was actually towards the fence beside the road and into a grassy field. It dawned on me that I hadn‚Äôt fully grasped or didn't bother researching what a ‚Äútrail run‚Äù entailed until I was knee-deep in it. No pavement here! We were out in the wild ‚Äî on the savanna, splashing through puddles, trudging through mud, navigating gravel, sand, and rocky ground, all while keeping an eye out for the guiding arrows along the way.

To add to the challenge, it started to rain halfway through. A small slip or trip could have been the end of my legacy. I was definitely not built for this! Other runners from the later-starting 5K race zoomed past me on the rocky path, barely glancing at the ground. Different breed, I thought. I lost and regained my morale several times, stopping frequently and tailing another runner, hoping their presence would motivate me to keep going. Most of the run felt pretty lonely since we started late, but I began to see more people near the end. Maybe it would have been more fun to stick with a companion rather than dashing off alone.

But we survived.

The trail run humbled me. It drained my energy and left me questioning whether I‚Äôd give it another try in the future. Perhaps it was the gear; perhaps it was my technique. I definitely wasn‚Äôt prepared. Here‚Äôs hoping I‚Äôll be ready for the next challenge!

## Rum, tea and sugar cane

Like many cultures, Mauritian people's love for tea have steeped in through several centuries of history. This passion led us to visit the oldest and biggest tea plantation in Mauritius, the Bois Cheri factory, which has been in operation since 1892. With a runny nose that day, I stepped out of the car in the morning and was instantly greeted by the brisk, chilly air. The climate in these highlands is absolutely perfect for cultivating superior quality tea, but not so much for my nose.

Our visit began at the tea museum, where we waited for the guided tour to start. Before long, the guide led us and several other tourists through the factory, explaining the delicate processes of picking, withering, rolling, fermenting, drying, and packaging the tea. Once the tour concluded, we moved on to a delightful tea-tasting experience at a tea house that boasted a stunning view of the plantation. We sampled a variety of teas laid out on the table ‚Äî vanilla, coconut, Earl Grey, green tea, herbal, and more. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if one could actually overdose on tea. But honestly, I wouldn't have minded sipping tea in that beautiful place all day long!

Today, I learned that black, green, and white tea all come from the same leaf but differ in how they‚Äôre processed. White tea is made from young buds that aren‚Äôt oxidized/fermented, resulting in a soft and delicate flavor. Black tea, on the other hand, is fermented and heat-processed for its rich, malty flavor. Green tea also goes without much fermentation and is heated quickly to retain its fresh taste. Other teas, like lemongrass and chrysanthemum, are infusions that create even more variety. Tea truly is wild!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/tea0.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/tea1.png "=500x500")

Aside from tea, we also paid a visit to the rum distillery in Chamarel. Sugar cane was first introduced to the island by the Dutch from Java back in 1639, followed by the French, and it has dominated the industry for much of its history. While I love sugarcane juice, today it‚Äôs primarily used for producing byproducts like rum. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of rum, but I still enjoyed the tour and the tastings that followed. They presented us with various types of rum and jams they produce, and it was entertaining to see our reactions with each taste. I even picked up a jar of banana jam to take home!

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/rum0.png "=500x500")

## Food

In the capital of Port Louis, a bustling neighborhood known as Chinatown awaits exploration. This lively area is a tapestry of culture, filled with colorful storefronts, aromatic food stalls, and the sounds of lively chatter. As a Chinese-Indonesian whose grandfather also migrated in early 1900s, this mix of Chinese culture felt close and familiar to me.  Wandering through the streets, I could hardly wait to dive into the culinary delights that awaited me.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/chinatown0.png "=500x500")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/chinatown1.png "=500x500")

During my visit, I was introduced to a variety of Chinese-Mauritian dishes, including a savory bowl of Mine Bouille (boiled noodles), Boulettes (dumplings served in various styles), Hakien (delicious deep-fried meat rolls), and Bol Renverse (upside-down bowl). Although it was my first time trying these dishes, they all felt incredibly comforting, warming my heart and making me wish I could eat them every single day. The Sino-Mauritian community makes up about 2-3% of the population, primarily consisting of the Hakka ethnicity. It was fascinating to see how many of these flavors have stuck around and evolved into distinct cultural dishes that reflect the island's diverse heritage.

The majority of population are in fact of Indian descent. I savored Dhal Puri, I tried the Kebab sandwich that was so delicious it could easily kick Subway out of business! One dinner, we also experienced dining at a Indian restaurant called Sitar, where I had one of the best Indian meals I've ever tasted. Freshly made roti accompanies to a variety of curry dishes like butter chicken and the shrimp masala.

![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/food1.png "=300x300")
![mauritius](adventures-in-mauritius/food2.png "=300x300")

But even better than all the street and restaurant food was the cooking of my host's mom, who graciously prepared meals during my stay. Most days, she whipped up a feast of freshly home-cooked dishes that were nothing short of delightful. Every vegetable was organically home-grown in her backyard, adding a magical touch of freshness and flavor to each meal that you just won't find in the grocery store. Each bite was sprinkled with a little bit of garden magic!

## Wedding and culture

One of the main reasons we came to Mauritius was to attend the wedding of my friend's relative. This Catholic Chinese wedding day began at the church, where we witnessed the beautiful ceremony that united the couple. Following the church service, we joined in for the tea ceremony, a Chinese tradition where the newlyweds offer tea to their older family members in exchange for red envelopes ‚Äî a symbol of blessings and good fortune.

In the afternoon, guests mingled on the patio during the pre-reception, enjoying the warm atmosphere and getting to know one another. Later, we were seated for the dinner at a semi-outdoor hall, where an impressive spread of food and an abundance of alcohol awaited us. It was a delightful feast, and I had the chance to meet a lot of friendly strangers in this joyous celebration.

After dinner, the real party began! Nearly all the guests stood and danced to the DJ. The music was lively, and the dance floor was packed with laughter and joy as everyone let loose and embraced the moment. I joined in, rediscovering my talent for dancing that I've never tapped into. With each song, we got more in rhythm, twirling and laughing alongside new friends. It was a night filled with unforgettable moments. It felt like we were all part of one big, happy family celebrating love and new beginnings!

## Language

Mauritian Creole is the lingua franca of the island, a French-based creole that has evolved through centuries of use by people from various linguistic backgrounds. Facinatingly, most people here also speak both French and English, as these languages are taught in schools, making everyone trilingual!

As a non-French speaker, I was eager to pick up some words during my stay, both in French and Creole, to a point where I couldn't truly blur the lines between the two languages. I found myself learning practical phrases that made my experience even more enjoyable. For instance, "mont lao" means "going up," while "descen avo" translates to "going down." I quickly learned that "bo" means "good", and "pa bo" means "not good", which came in handy when discussing food. "Mari" means "very", and "du" means "sweet", perfect for describing the delicious treats I encountered.

I also picked up some essential phrases like "mo pe fe", which means "I'm hungry", and "mo pa pe fe", meaning "I'm not hungry". "Tu" translates to "you," and "alongzi" means "let's go," which was great for rallying my friends for adventures. I became a natural at saying "merci", "dizef" for "egg", "avec" for "and", and "fatigue" for "tired". "Mo ka gen en hakkien," meaning "I want a hakkien," was handy for whenever I craved those delicious deep-fried meat rolls.

By the end of my trip, I felt like I had a little piece of the local language in my pocket, making my experience in Mauritius all the more enriching!

## Reflecting back

This was my trip of the year. Discovering so many new places, foods, cultures, languages, activities, people, experiences, and histories made a lasting impression on this paradise island. It was a journey I would never have imagined embarking on without having certain people in that moment of my life, and I'm very thankful for that.

Perhaps it's true that not all those who wander are lost; sometimes, wandering leads to the most profund discoveries. The trip expanded my view of the world, of myself, and my place within it. Experiencing a different way of life had pushed me out of my comfort zone and transformed myself into someone new. Each encounter, every bite of food, and all the laughter shared. Now that you've read through my adventure, I'd like to thank you for getting it this far with me. Can't wait for the next adventure!
