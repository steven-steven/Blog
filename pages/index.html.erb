  Hi, my name is Steven.
  <br />
  Programming has always been my vocation. I love tinkering, learning and going through a rabbit-hole of interesting thoughts.
  What will I do in 5 years time? Those are unanswered questions but I'll find out!
  <br />
  I created this site as a platform for personal reflection, summarizing books I've read, courses, hobbies, life experiences, or just random thoughts I'd like to pass on. It helps me document many ever-changing thoughts that's too computationally heavy for this unreliable RAM in my head.
  <br />
  I'm not entirely sure what this blog means to you reading it. It could just end up being a bunch of insignificant ramblings, terrible humor, and typos or grammatical errors. But I hope you can get something positive out.
