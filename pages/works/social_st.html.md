![Social St](introducing-socialst/logo.svg "=200x200")

SocialSt.com is a social web app to host and join all sorts of activities around the area. Similar to [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/), [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ca/), [radius.to](https://radius.to/), [lu.ma](https://lu.ma/) (this I just recently discovered, and it looks so good ðŸ«¢). But unlike any, I'd like Social St to capture interactions that are less structural and more spontaneous like:

- finding companions to get coffee
- going out on a walk, co-working
- a table tennis partner
- boba picnic at the park
- grab dinner

The opportunities to meet people are endless! Social St empowers anyone to host **any** type of activities at any time during the day, or join one in their community.

At Social St, we believe in the power of cultivating a tribe of like-minded individuals. It is the easiest way to connect with a buddy who shares the same interests as you, do activities together, bounce around ideas, get pumped up, swap stories, and just feel like you truly belong. And guess what? The world's got an endless supply of that good stuff!
