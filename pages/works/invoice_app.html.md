I created an invoicing native application, with Electron front-end, Golang backend, and Firebase DB. Users can enter inventory items, customer profiles and payment histories, the invoice data, and download/print the invoice as PDF. With its offline capability, their data are saved dirty in the device local disk and synced to the online DB as soon as a connection is detected.

For a full overview, you could checkout [this reflection post of the first version](/blog/creating-an-invoice-app-with-electron-and-go) from August 2020, and [another post of the second version update](/blog/building-invoice-app-v2).

Also note that the content of the app is Indonesian.
