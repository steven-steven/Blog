Creative teams juggle deliverables, revisions, approvals, and client communication across tools that weren’t built for creative workflows. Communication gets messy, approvals slow down, and agencies lose billable hours and cash flow

ARTISH is a prompt-based project management tool designed around how creative work actually
moves—from brief to submission to approval. ARTISH turns prompts into structured projects with clear submissions, reviews, and automatic progress tracking.
