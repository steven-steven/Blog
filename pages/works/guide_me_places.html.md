**Guide Me Places** is a side-project I built recently. I curate places to visit, and display coordinates üìç in an interactive map to help people like me discover and explore all corners of Indonesia. On top of that, I've curated a feed of articles and stories from fellow travelers users can browse through when they select a location in the map.
