In computing, Unix time (also known as Epoch time, Posix time, seconds since the Epoch, Unix timestamp or UNIX Epoch time) is a system for describing a point in time. It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, excluding leap seconds. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

You can read more about when the Unix epoch started at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

This post isn't really about that thoughâ€”rather its a post that's written to definitely be from the past unless you're time traveling or setting your clock before 1970.
