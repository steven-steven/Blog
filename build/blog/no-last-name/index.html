    <p>Here are some FAQs about me: Is your last name Steven? Can I have your last name? How come you don&rsquo;t have a last name? Is your dad&rsquo;s last name Steven?</p>

<p>You know, if I had a dollar every time someone asks about my last name, I&rsquo;d probably afford paying my uni tuition for next term. (I&rsquo;m exaggerating. international student tuition are too insane).</p>

<h2 id="my-answer">My Answer</h2>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d write a post to answer them all. But to be honest, I never had a good answer for it. It&rsquo;s just the way it is - both my parents have no last name too.</p>

<p>If you need an answer, read:link:<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_asia/article/j5xmgp/the-uniquely-indonesian-pains-of-having-only-one-name" target="_blank">This Vice Article</a> by Alice (just Alice). You can simply replace the word &lsquo;Alice&rsquo; into &lsquo;Steven&rsquo; in that article, and that would be my story too.</p>

<p>She talked about the assimilation policies in the 1967 Suharto era, which caused many Indonesian Chinese to loose their ancestral names, and the difficulty of registering a last name in those days. Not 100% sure if this was the case for me since I was born a year after the end of Suharto&rsquo;s regime. But who knows, maybe my parents had just forgotten or didn&rsquo;t bother to put one for me :baby:</p>

<h3 id="i-do-have-a-chinese-name">I do have a Chinese Name</h3>

<p>My Chinese name spells out as Huang De Di. Like most names, it&rsquo;s what my parents gave me when I was born. However, it&rsquo;s not written in any legal papers, and no one calls me that. It&rsquo;s kind of shameful to say, but I don&rsquo;t really know how to write it in Chinese either :no_mouth: (have to ask my dad).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&rdquo; - saying</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can I say that it&rsquo;s my name if it isn&rsquo;t registered/used anywhere and by anyone?</p>

<h3 id="is-it-common-for-indonesian-to-have-no-last-name">Is it common for Indonesian to have no last name?</h3>

<p>Not really</p>

<h3 id="steven-steven">Steven Steven</h3>

<p>I should clarify that my full name in passport is &lsquo;Steven&rsquo;. For administrative reasons, the school and the companies I worked at had me registered as &lsquo;Steven Steven&rsquo;. When I purchase a plane ticket, sign a contract for rent, or open up a bank account, and it requires a first and last name, I put in &lsquo;Steven Steven&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A part of me feels guilty sometimes for &lsquo;lying&rsquo; about my last name. But what should I do when I can&rsquo;t leave it blank? I mean, for the sake of inclusivity, maybe people should consider leaving the last-name field as optional in their form. Jk.</p>

<h3 id="loosing-identity-and-existential-crisis">Loosing Identity and Existential Crisis</h3>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t mind. I am more than just a name and it is simply a way for others to identify me. So as long as I&rsquo;m the only &lsquo;Steven Steven&rsquo; in the room, it&rsquo;s all good.</p>

<p>Despite that, I think in most cases, a last name is supposed to represent your roots. Not knowing what my last name is, feels like I&rsquo;m stranded all alone without any affiliation with my family or where I came from.</p>

<p>I definitely want to try doing an ancestry test someday.</p>

<h3 id="oh-shit-not-this-again">Oh Shit. Not this again..</h3>

<p>I have lots of moments when I had to give someone my full name (registered in their system) and I tell them:</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Steven Steven&rdquo;</p>

<p>He/She: &ldquo;Steven&hellip; what&rsquo;s your last name&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Steven. Steven Steven&rdquo;</p>

<p>He/She: &ldquo;Uh.. Steven Steven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: *nods</p>

<p>He/She: &ldquo;Uh.. okay..&rdquo;</p>

<p>I must say that it&rsquo;s undeniably a paperwork nightmare!! ðŸ˜±
Especially when the opposing speaker doesn&rsquo;t believe you or thinks you&rsquo;re joking. Imagine having to justify yourself every time you tell your full name.</p>

<p>To this day, I still get irritated sometimes but I do understand that it&rsquo;s not anyone&rsquo;s fault. Maybe I should just change my name.</p>

<p>Leave a comment and I&rsquo;m always open to suggestions for a last name :D</p>
