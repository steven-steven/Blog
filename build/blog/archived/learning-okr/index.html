    <p>Last December, I picked up a book called &ldquo;Measure What Matters&rdquo;, by John Doerr :blue_book:. The book is centered around OKR, a goal-setting methodology used in many big companies including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and my recent company I interned at, Loblaw Digital.</p>

<p><img src="https://steven-steven.github.io/Blog/assets/images/blogAssets/learning-okr/measureWhatMatters.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Measure What Matters" style="margin: 1.5rem auto;"></p>

<p>In fact, before I chose to read this book, OKR (Objectives and Key Results) has entered my ears a few times this term. During my 4-months term at Loblaw Digital, I&rsquo;ve been in one of my team&rsquo;s discussions about deciding what key-result goals we&rsquo;d like to have in order to meet our set of objectives. Just to throw an example out there, one of our key resut was to reduce the error rate by x% for our API. We also discussed in detail about how these metrics will be measured. Apart from that I&rsquo;ve been actively listening to :headphones: GoFigure podcast by GoJek (Indonesia&rsquo;s Decacorn Super App), where they also coined the term OKR a few times.</p>

<p>So I looked it up and I thought that I might try it out and create my very own personal OKR to :soccer: kick-off 2020 with a kick-ass set of goals and commitments.</p>

<p>Those were my process of discovering this book. Nevertheless after reading it, I was :heavy<em>dollar</em>sign:old and was utterly convinced that everyone should give OKR a try. The OKR was never meant to be the typical &lsquo;set it and forget it&rsquo; goals. If done properly, the OKR is meant to live and continuously drive clarity, accountability, and improvements for individuals and organizations.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I&rsquo;d like to brief through some key points I&rsquo;ve learned from this book (pretty much a compilation of my notes while reading it). :hand: If you don&rsquo;t want spoilers - stop here and go read that book. If you just want to learn more about OKRs - read on! :point_right:</p>

<p><u><em>Disclaimer</em></u>: Most of these contents came right from the book &ldquo;Measure What Matters&rdquo;. They have all the credit, and I hope you&rsquo;ll give them a read after reading this post. I apologize if there are anything that&rsquo;s incorrect. Please let me know if there are.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-okr">What is OKR</h2>

<p>It is a structured goal setting protocol. Note that it&rsquo;s simply a guideline and there are many variation of implementation. But most commonly, you have 3-4 objectives and for each objectives you have 3-5 key results. There&rsquo;s no rule to how long an OKR lives, these can be quarterly or year-long goals. An objective is the direction you&rsquo;d like to aim for. While the key results are specific measurable milestones that will contribute to the objective (should be measured by some metric such as # of revenue, growth, active users, market share, customer engagement, etc).</p>

<p>Occationally (ie. daily or weekly), you&rsquo;d check-in to your OKR to reflect how well you&rsquo;re doing to achieve the goal, how you plan to get back on track, or whether you should scrape it. Yes, OKR can be scraped at any point. OKR is meant to be a work in progress, not permanent goals.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a quarterly OKR, and at the end of each quarter you would score how well you achieve those key-results (ie. 0 to 10) based on the metrics. You will assess yourself, and set another OKR for the next quarter. Ideally, you want to get a middle score like 6 or 7. If your score is too high, it means your goal isn&rsquo;t big enough.</p>

<p>OKR is also made transparant to foster alignment and accountability within an organization. You know what your manager&rsquo;s OKR is, even up to the CEO and other department&rsquo;s OKR. By doing this, you can clearly see how your objectives ties in to the bigger picture of upper tier management. And if you know everyone&rsquo;s goals it&rsquo;ll help foster teamwork and collaboration within the organization.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you get a heirarchy of OKRs. At the top being the company OKR, then below that you may have the manager&rsquo;s OKR, then the team&rsquo;s OKR, then even individual OKRs. You&rsquo;ll stand out if your goals aren&rsquo;t alligned properly with the larger purpose.</p>

<p>That is OKR in a nutshell :peanuts:. It helps individuals and the organization to realize their priorities, what exactly they&rsquo;re doing, how, and why. Particularly, the book discusses 4 main points that OKR offers - and it&rsquo;s called the 4 OKR Super Powers.</p>

<h3 id="the-4-okr-super-powers">The 4 OKR Super Powers</h3>

<h4 id="1-focus-and-commit-to-priorities">1. Focus and commit to priorities</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>If we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing - Andy Grove</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OKR helps clarify your priorities. You should ideally only set 3 to 5 key-results, so it helps to focus on what counts most to achieve the objective.</p>

<p>People needs meaning (not just milestones) for motivation to commit. With OKR, you know exatly your purpose and how achieving your objectives will impact the organization. If you fail, then you have an idea of how that might bring other&rsquo;s objectives down along with it.</p>

<h4 id="2-align-and-connect-for-teamwork">2. Align and connect for teamwork</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>“If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.”  - Stephen Covey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Down from the company&rsquo;s North Star, the CEO, the managers, to teams and employees, everyone&rsquo;s OKR should be made transparant. Transparancy seeds collaboration :handshake:. It knits individual work to team efforts. It also help others to recognize what out priorities and our limits are, and they&rsquo;ll adjust their expectations accordingly.</p>

<p>OKR aids vertical alignment since one will align their objectives to the goals set by the top-tier management (the bigger purpose).</p>

<p>For horizontal alignment (cross functional/departments), people can see what&rsquo;s going on in the other team,  and connect to them if they see something interesting or whenever there&rsquo;s opportunity to collaborate. When an OKR of one of the team is in trouble, other teams can help. The idea is there shouldn&rsquo;t be any judgements to failures, just a problem to be solved. There should be no shame in failing. OKR helps to fail smart and fast</p>

<p>Other Cautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alignment is not redundancy - co-ownership weakens accountability. So even if two objectives are the same, key results should be different</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-track-for-accountability">3. Track for Accountability</h4>

<p>OKR is measurable. It involves real metrics, objective grading, and continuous reassessment. They live, unlike traditional &lsquo;set them and forget them&rsquo; goals.</p>

<p>The 3-step life cycle of an OKR are follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Setup</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>It needs to be public (There are cloud-based OKR management software)</p></li>
<li><p>There can be an <strong>OKR Shepherd</strong>. Person who make sure OKR system is properly adopted.</p>

<ul>
<li>an email by  Jonathan Rosenberg, senior VP at Google (and the OKR shepherd), to employees who didn&rsquo;t get their OKRs on time:
&gt; &ldquo;&hellip;.  We have so many great opportunities before us (search, ads, display, YouTube,Android, enterprise, local, commerce, Chrome, TV, mobile, social &hellip;) that if you can’t come up with OKRs that get you excited about coming to work every day,then something must be wrong. In fact, if that’s really the case, come see me&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Midlife Tracking</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>You share your progress with everyone.</li>
<li>You check-in weekly to assess your progress. OKRs are adaptable by nature, and you have 4 options - to continue if it&rsquo;s on track, update the OKR if it needs attention, start a new OKR whenever needed, stop an OKR if it&rsquo;s at risk or obsolete. Don&rsquo;t forget to reflect for those decisions.</li>
<li>Frequency of team check-ins may very (ie.  The more dispersed the team’s members, the more frequently they should touch base)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>The Wrap-up (Rinse and repeat) :traffic_light:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Objective Scoring</strong> - Google use 0-1 scale. (0.7 up is green/delivered)(0.4-0.6 is yellow/made progress but fell short) (0-0.3 failed to make progress)</li>
<li><strong>Subjective Self-assesment</strong> - <u>Score</u> themselves subjectively based on what they think they deserve (ie. effort, impact). And <u>self-assesment</u> for each key results. Essentially numbers are less important then the feedback and discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection</strong> - retrospective and forward-looking at the same time. Anunfinished objective might be rolled over to the next quarter, with a fresh set of key results—or perhaps its moment has passed, and it is appropriately dropped.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 3 steps ensures that goal-setting becomes part of the process, and made sure everyone will be accountable for the goals they set. One point about OKR is that it&rsquo;s a self-governed social contract. You don&rsquo;t push towards a goal because it&rsquo;s the boss&rsquo;s order. You do it because it&rsquo;s important to the company and your colleagues are counting on you.</p>

<h4 id="4-stretch-for-amazing">4. Stretch for Amazing</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Stretch goals are risky goals with ~40% success rate. Ideally some of your objectives needs to be stretch goals (focus on the bigger future), and some are commitments (crucial things to keep things running).</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch goals lets us test the limits, and there is always a freedom of failure. It helps release our most creative and ambitious selves.</p></li>
<li><p>Gospel of 10x: The idea that we should improve the existing system by an order of magnitude. By doing this, it requires engineers to rethink problems, exploring what’s technically possible, and redesigning the architecture, storage, to prepare for the future. It forces a reset. People start thinking BIGGER.</p>

<ul>
<li>&gt; ie. Objective: &ldquo;We should make the web as fast as flipping through a magazine &rdquo;
&gt;
&gt; ie. Objective: &ldquo;1 billion daily watch hours&rdquo; (Youtube)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At the same time, stretch goals cannot seem like a long march to nowhere. Leaders must convey <u>importance of outcome</u> and <u>belief that it&rsquo;s attainable</u>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Art of Framing: (ie. 1 billion daily watch hours sounds alot but if you frame it to be less than 20% of world&rsquo;s tv watch time, people starts believing). When making stretch goals, know that there&rsquo;s another bigger thing, and we&rsquo;re going somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t overlook things. OKR can be a religion. Respect religion but sometimes it can be detremental if not managed properly.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-we-need-goals">Why we need goals</h3>

<p>Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction. It helps us strive for what might seem beyond reach. It lets us celebrate wins (big or small), and rewards &lsquo;good fails&rsquo;. It makes sure you act purposefully to plans, rather than just reacting to external events on the fly.</p>

<h4 id="the-traditional-method">The traditional method</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>Taylor Ford Model</em>: An authoritarian model used by organizations in the past. Employees were told what to do, and they were expected to do it in the best/cheapest way. This was thought to be most efficient and profitable.</li>
<li>Goals, is commonly tied to salaries/bonuses. This kept employees from taking risk. Compensation and goal-settings are entirely unrelated.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="possible-difficulties-with-okr-goals">Possible difficulties with OKR goals</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>OKR</em> emphasize on measured output (ie. I want to achieve this by the end of the quarter), instead of increase in activity. However some jobs pay people to think. The question is, how can we measure output for these knowledge workers? (we should always have a metric to measure these key results)</li>
<li>Trust employees to make their own key results. People who choose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get there (let them define the &lsquo;how&rsquo;). However, when things are critical and <em>doing</em> takes precedence, being directive is an option. (You need the perfect balance depending on the situation)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cfr-continuous-perfomance-management">CFR (Continuous Perfomance Management)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Conversations: authentic rich exchange betweenmanager and contributor (aim: drive performance)</li>
<li>Feedback: Bidirectional/networked among peers to evaluate progress</li>
<li>Recognition: Expressing appreciation to individuals for contribution of all sizes</li>
</ul>

<p>One part of the book talks about CFR. These are more in the perspective of a manager and the company, to support an OKR culture. It&rsquo;s the discussions that must take place one-on-one between managers and employees to help them engage and grow their career in the company.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-might-take-out-of-this-individual-okr">What I might take out of this: Individual OKR?</h2>

<p>Throughout the book, I realize that OKR is designed for organizations. And when it&rsquo;s about personal goals, maybe it isn&rsquo;t really what OKR is designed for. But people do make individual OKRs (I googled them and they exist).</p>

<p>So at a personal level, I believe OKR will help me clarify what my priorities are. It will help me reset my compass - :juggling: no matter how crazy things get, I can default back to what truly matters. And hopefully it will also connect me to something bigger and more meaningful - a stretch goal.</p>

<p>So beginning from 2020, I&rsquo;ll give it a shot. My 2020 OKR:</p>

<h3 id="by-the-time-of-writing">By the time of writing&hellip;</h3>

<p>By the time of writing, it has been a week past when I first made my OKR. It&rsquo;s also my first week of school, and I&rsquo;ve been hitting some goals on target, while not others. I kept track of it in an online tool called &lsquo;Profit.co&rsquo;, but I find it easier to have a physical calendar where I just check-off my daily goals.</p>

<p>For example, I started a habit of waking up early and cooking meals no problem. However, things like doing 100 leetcode problems might be too hard on myself and unrealistic, especially when I havent build the habit of doing it daily. So I&rsquo;m thinking of changing it to doing leetcode problems an hour each day. As I get busy in term, I have no doubt that more will change. So be it. No judgements there.</p>

<h3 id="1-month-later">1 Month Later&hellip;</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s 27 February. This will make me pathetic for the internet to see. But tbh it&rsquo;s too hard to continue. :cry:</p>

<p>I found that the hardest thing to do is to keep track. When you&rsquo;re in Engineering school some days are just a hustle. Exams coming up, keeping up with classes, and out-of-school student teams (joined Blueprint this term). And that was my excuse to make me feel better :sunglasses:. Felt much better now.</p>

<p>Sure, maybe new year resolutions really only last till January. But during that one month I felt like it was getting somewhere, as I tracked myself everyday. I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it was for nothing. I&rsquo;ve continued to execute a few of these new habits (such as cleaning house every Saturday, cooking, rock climbing, and maybe sleeping early sometimes :sweat_smile:).</p>

<p>Any how, can&rsquo;t believe half-quarter of the year had passed. I won&rsquo;t continue tracking my OKR but I&rsquo;ll try to keep it at the back of my brain.</p>
