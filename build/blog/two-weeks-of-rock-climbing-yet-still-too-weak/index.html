<p><strong>Disclaimer: This is a reflection from a newb climber. May contain misleading and incorrect information. Seek a real rock climbing expert for better suggestions.</strong></p>

<p>Tomorrow marks the end of my two week membership at Boulderz Climbing Centre at Junction Triangle in Toronto. I&rsquo;ve been going to that gym once every 2 days. Which means I have 1 day to recover, and that was incredibly challenging for me especially when I injured myself. But I gotta make the most out of my membership right? (It was just 30ish CAD)</p>

<p>How it all Began:
Two weeks ago Steven Xiong, a friend in my class, asked me if I wanted to rock climb with him. I had <em>the thought</em> of doing it a few times in the past but never had I actually gone to try it. So I replied with a BIG YES!</p>

<p>I mean, I am strong enough to hold a handstand and I can do at least 5 pullups; so surely moving my weight between rocks wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult right?</p>

<h2 id="i-was-wrong">I was wrong</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/blogAssets/two-weeks-of-rock-climbing/flap.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Flap Injury" style="margin: 1.5rem auto;"></p>

<p>Sorry about the gory image above. I got a flap. Apparently it&rsquo;s a common injury in climbing. I was lucky it wasn&rsquo;t deep and could&rsquo;ve prevented it if I moisture my hands enough or be more careful when climbing.</p>

<p>Some pros I see in that gym didn&rsquo;t seem as well-built as I expected them to be. I get the impression that all you really need, is to be <strong>Technique</strong>-ally capable (excuse my English), and that takes LOTS of experience and training.</p>

<p>Here are the few points I learned over the past 2 weeks:</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-legs-and-ass">Focus on legs and ass</h3>

<p>I should focus on legs instead of climbing with my arms, since my legs are so much stronger. Therefore carry your wait on your foot.</p>

<p>For example, I should decide which footholds to step on before shifting to the next position.</p>

<p>I pay a lot of attention on my ass while climbing. Not because of the people watching :peach:, but I think that it shows where my center of mass is. It&rsquo;s bad if I have to carry my weight around. Instead, I should shift the weight to my legs. For example, I would try to shift my lower half to be close to my foot so that it carries all the weight. In short, <u>bend the knees</u>.</p>

<h3 id="hands-straight">Hands straight</h3>

<p>I heard this advise a lot. Like how its easier to carry a shopping bag, or how monkeys hang on a tree, a straight arm put less strain and energy compared to a bent arm.
Of course, you will need to bend your arms to move around, but when I&rsquo;m holding a position, I find it really helpful to extend my arms.</p>

<h3 id="my-fingers-hurt">My fingers hurt</h3>

<p>I am still having trouble with it, but I do feel more conformable climbing with my fingers now compared to when I first started. I think I should use more of my <em>distant phalange</em> (the upper section of the finger) more than the <em>middle/proximal phalanges</em> (lower section of the finger).
For one thing, it hurts less. When I grab the rocks using the middle phalanges, I feel tortured. It felt like that part of the fingers are pinched so hard.</p>

<p>My fingers are still too weak for the hangboard. You are supposed to hang yourself with only your fingers on the board. It is torture but I hope my fingers can get strong enough for it.</p>

<h3 id="flagging-and-back-stepping">Flagging and Back-stepping</h3>

<p>When I see pros climb, they seem to make moves that is not apparant to me. After some research I discovered the arts of <em>Flagging</em> and <em>Backstepping</em>. It provides balance, and they are aware of which positions would be the most efficient (minimal strength).
I&rsquo;m guessing this is something I&rsquo;d only get by more practice. Being self-aware about my balance positions.</p>

<h3 id="shoes">Shoes</h3>

<p>Halfway through I just realized that everyone wasn&rsquo;t wearing socks. Which was a big revelation because exposing your toes on the shoes definitely gave me more control.
Another thing I noticed is it gets so smelly after climbing! I&rsquo;m rethinking if I should buy my own climbing shoes.</p>

<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>

<p>Its all about the <em>Beta</em>. You&rsquo;re given a bunch of rocks on the wall and you should plan out how to reach the top, in the most effective way of course.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-think-i-can-improve">How I think I can improve</h2>

<ol>
<li>practice</li>
<li>watch people do it and imitate</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that I don&rsquo;t have climbing friends to go with me. I feel it would help lots if someone spectates you as they can give you a better feedback than your own pair of eyes.</p>

<h2 id="would-i-do-it-again">Would I do it again?</h2>

<p>Hell yeah! Definitely going to extend my membership. It was fun.</p>

<ul>
<li>  What I love about this sport is that it doesn&rsquo;t feel like working out. It&rsquo;s about problem solving.</li>
<li>  The only thing I hate is my weak fingers and arms. They&rsquo;re not letting me get to where I want, and they get worn out quickly after just a few climbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to do it as efficiently as I could so I can conserve my energy for longer climbs. But as for now, I&rsquo;ll trust that my fingers will get stronger over time.</p>
