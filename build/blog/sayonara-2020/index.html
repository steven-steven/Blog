    <p>Let&rsquo;s start the year with a resolution. If last year was 720p, lets aim for HD Resolution this year! A‚Ä¶ha..haaa..</p>

<p>In all seriousness, 2020 wasn&rsquo;t bad at all for me. I know it was a bad year. I wanna give a huge condolence for those who lost their loved ones, lost their jobs, lost their homes, and is placed in a tough spot since the pandemic begun.</p>

<h2 id="2020">2020</h2>

<p>In 2020, I was blessed with 2 insanely busy school terms and a wonderful 4-month internship at StackAdapt. Met and worked with amazing individuals. I also found more time to geek out on new things/skills I never tried before - like FPV drones, keyboard, leetcode, cooking, stock investments, etc. I came to love coding a lot more than ever before since it&rsquo;s pretty much my main source of entertainment and brings purpose that I can look forward to when I wake up everyday.</p>

<p>A few highlights to the year:</p>

<h4 id="moving-from-old-windows-laptop-to-a-mac">Moving from old windows laptop to a Mac üçé</h4>

<p>So this is what no lag feels like! My computer&rsquo;s so much faster..</p>

<h4 id="doing-the-daily-leetcode-challange">Doing the Daily Leetcode Challange üë®‚Äçüíª</h4>

<p>I begin doing Leetcode Daily Challenge (it gives a random problem everyday) for the last 4 months or so. On average I spend about an 30 min - 1 hour per day, and occasionally up to 5h for a hard problem. When I give up I normally look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl3tJFKsFrw2p_Wxf1YDSow" target="_blank">&lsquo;Programming with Larry&rsquo;</a> on Youtube (came across by chance but I really recommend his videos). Larry streams and record himself solving it live, so it&rsquo;s normally super helpful to listen to his thought process on the spot before reaching to a solution, rather than your normal &lsquo;here&rsquo;s your solution&rsquo; type of videos.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blogAssets/sayonara-2020/dailyChallenge.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Daily Challange" style="margin: 1.5rem auto;"></p>

<p>I feel like I am much more comfortable problem-solving and identifying which appropriate techniques to use for a given problem. I try my best keeping a note of heuristics, although I think most of it is learned subconsciously. Tbh I probably forgot most of the questions I&rsquo;ve solved LOL. IDK do shoot me a msg if you have suggestions of a better method of keeping note/heuristics so it sticks.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blogAssets/sayonara-2020/leetcodeNotes.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Leetcode Notes" style="margin: 1.5rem auto;"></p>

<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m still FAR from good. But It&rsquo;s fun and I look forward to continue improving this year (Yes Dynamic Programming, I&rsquo;m staring at you). Hopefully will try out Leetcode weekly contest this year once I feel more comfortable.</p>

<h4 id="new-tech-stacks-to-put-in-my-repertoire">New tech stacks to put in my repertoire</h4>

<p>This year I get to touch on Ruby on Rails, Go, ElectronJS for the first time, and the AWS CCP thing. Also lurked on some ML stuff occasionally for fun (on Educative.io). I got myself a 1 year subscription for Educative.io. After going on the free trial last year, I like the type of lessons they provide (all text-based) since learning by reading allows me to go at my own pace (usually faster) compared to watching videos.</p>

<h4 id="fpv">FPV</h4>

<p>I have 3 tiny whoops before I realize it. I&rsquo;ve broken 2 motors, and a flight controller (from the snow). Big Oof. Not so much of the price, but more to the hate of waiting for replacement parts to ship.</p>

<h4 id="buying-my-first-ever-stock">Buying my first ever stock</h4>

<p>Tried out Wealthsimple&rsquo;s auto-investment and manual trading account few months ago.</p>

<h4 id="new-keyboard">New Keyboard</h4>

<p>I started using The Moonlander (a split keyboard). It&rsquo;s my first mechanical and ortholinear keyboard and it definitely increases my typing speed so much, *after a lot of practice and typing tests. I can program my own key bindings, and it&rsquo;s really easy to update the firmware. For now I have the following key bindings (probably will change over time as I find new ways to automate my common shortcuts):</p>

<h4 id="movies-films-manga">Movies/films/Manga:</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost always watching stuff when I&rsquo;m having dinner nowadays since I got no one to eat with üò¢. Absolutely loved Queen&rsquo;s bandit and Alice in Borderland. I followed quite a few Kdramas here and there. Also&hellip; super honored to witness Chapter 1000 of One Piece this year!</p>

<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>

<p>This year will be extremely pivotal, since I&rsquo;d be graduating on May. After that‚Ä¶ hopefully a good fulltime position.</p>

<p>I recently watched Jackson Gabbard&rsquo;s video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgdS0EUmn70" target="_blank">Architecture and Systems Designs</a> and he raised a few good points.</p>

<ol>
<li>Exposure to architecture/design problems.

<ul>
<li>One could argue/say &lsquo;my company don&rsquo;t give me exposure to these types of problems&rsquo;. However often times exposure is not limited to the things you work on. People talk about these design problems occasionally in work whether during one-on-one chats, tech talks, engineering blogs, conferences, white papers, etc.</li>
<li>People who&rsquo;s good at design problems, don&rsquo;t solve this type of problems everyday, but surround themselves with the proper environment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>From the recruiter&rsquo;s perspective not knowing something during the interview sometimes do indicate your capability/drive to learn

<ul>
<li>For example if a potential employee have 8 years of industry experience, but hasn&rsquo;t get the amount of technical skills that the employers need, it sort of shows that they are the type of person to be &lsquo;complacent&rsquo; during their career, rather than someone who continues to push themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Point No 2 scares me a bit to be honest. It&rsquo;s like the score you&rsquo;re given is not only based on skill alone but rather (score = skill / time). In accounting term I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;d be analogous to the concept of &lsquo;Time Value of Money (TVM)&rsquo; where the same amount of money now will be discounted in value over time.</p>

<p>On that note, I probably want to set myself on reading more this year. Engineering blogs, conferences, research papers, etc. Surrounding and exposing myself with how other people solve their problems.</p>

<p>I came back to Notion recently to maybe keep track of a reading log for myself. Hopefully the habit will stick in.</p>
